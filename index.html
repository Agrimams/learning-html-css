Technologies in the field of web design are no exception. As web-related hardware and software components became faster, more reliable, and easier to use, the web exploded with new websites which led to a dramatic increase in web usage around the world.

        But as web designers and audiences well know, the web is still in great need of improvement.

        A web designer might separate the header, body text, and sidebar of a webpage by putting each into a different cell. In addition, the web designer could put each link button on the header and sidebar into a separate cell so that he or she could define unique properties for each button. Then, within the body of the page, the web designer could separate the textual and graphical elements into different cells to control spacing and other attributes individually.
